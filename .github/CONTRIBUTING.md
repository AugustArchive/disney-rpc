# Contributions
Thanks for thinking on contributions! Every little piece of help always goes a long way, read below of how to setup and submit a pull request!

## Setting Up
First, you will need to have ESLint and TypeScript installed on your system to continue the process. You can install them using ``npm i -g eslint typescript``.

- Fork the repository [here](https://github.com/auguwu/docs/fork)
- Clone the repository to your local machine (``git clone https://github.com/USERNAME/docs``)
- Change the directory to the cloned repo (``cd docs``) and create a seperate branch (``git checkout -b <branch>``)
- Install any local dependencies from NPM (``npm i``)
- Update the codebase or documentation
  - Run ``npm run lint`` to check for any code errors/warnings, this follows the ESLint configuration [here](https://github.com/auguwu/eslint-config).
  - Run ``npm run build`` to compile TypeScript and check for any compliation errors
- Then, submit your [pull request](https://github.com/auguwu/disney-rpc/compare) and wait a few minutes or a few hours for the maintainers to look at your Pull Request and ask for any changes or it'll be merged.
